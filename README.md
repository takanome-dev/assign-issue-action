This action simplifies issue management for maintainers and contributors, making collaboration more efficient.
See the list of [features](#features) below for more details.

## Features

- 📝 Self-assign issues using `/assign-me` command (default)
- 🗑️ Self-unassign from issues using `/unassign-me` command (default)
- 👥 Maintainer-controlled assignments using `/assign @<user>` and `/unassign @<user>` commands
- 🎉 Different welcome messages for first-time contributors vs returning contributors
- ⏰ Automatic unassignment of inactive issues after configurable period (default: 7 days)
- 🛡️ Block self-reassignment after unassignment (requires maintainer approval)
- 🚫 Prevent issue authors from self-assigning their own issues (optional, for roadmap control)
- 🔔 Send reminder notifications before automatic unassignment occurs
- 🔢 Limit the maximum number of issues a user can be assigned to simultaneously (default: 3)
- 🎯 Per-label assignment limits to encourage progression from beginner to advanced issues (e.g., limit "good first issue" to 2 assignments)
