This action simplifies issue management for maintainers and contributors, making collaboration more efficient.
Enable commands that streamline issue assignments:

- `/assign-me` for contributors to self-assign.
- `/unassign-me` for self-unassignment.
- `/assign @<user>` for maintainers to assign specific users.
- `/unassign @<user>` for maintainers to unassign others easily.

It can also unassign issues that have been assigned for a configured amount of time.

## üíª Usage

Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/assign.yml` learn more about [Creating a Workflow file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows#creating-a-workflow-file)):

```yaml

  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 * * *
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  assign:
    permissions:
      issues: write
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Assign the user or unassign stale assignments
        uses: takanome-dev/assign-issue-action@beta
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          maintainers: '' # list of maintainers with comma separated like 'takanome-dev,octocat'
